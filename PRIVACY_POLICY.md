## TVX Player: Privacy policy

Welcome to the TVX Player app for Android!

This is an open source Media Player Android app developed by Vineeth Nair. The source code is available on GitHub.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (user preferences (like settings/filters), caches) created by you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO
android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO

Above listed permissions are required to read media files stored on your device. Read-Only permissions are required for this app to work and it won't be able to delete or alter media files with these permissions.



If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to address the same.

Yours sincerely,  
Vineeth Nair
